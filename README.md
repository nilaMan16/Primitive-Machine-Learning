Adoroni! This is the reposoitory of some of my first machine learning projects. I am still in the learning phase of the basics of Machine Learning and it's implementations. The various models used in my projects, as of now include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Means Clustering etc.
